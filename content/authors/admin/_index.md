Welcome to my personal site.

I am a researcher and political economist based in the [European Institute](http://www.lse.ac.uk/european-institute) at the London School of Economics. My primary interests include comparative political economy and public policy in contemporary Europe, with a particular substantive focus on banking, finance and industrial policy.

At the LSE, I am a team member on the ERC-funded project *[Policy Crisis and Crisis Politics. Sovereignty, Solidarity and Identity in the EU Post-2008 (SOLID)](https://solid-erc.eu/).* Faced with a ‘polycrisis’, multiple overlapping crises presenting deep and at times existential challenges to its support and authority, the European project has thus far proven surprisingly durable. SOLID brings together political scientists across three universities (LSE, EUI, University of Milan). We are working to make sense of the crisis politics of the past decade and its implications for Europe as a polity going forward.

I completed my PhD at the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence, Italy. Here, my thesis research compared responses to the too-big-to-fail problem presented by large banks in the UK, Netherlands and Germany after the subprime financial crisis of 2008-09. Against conventional views that privilege economic structures as constant determinants of financial regulation, I suggest that political dynamics, specifically competition between parties in and out of government, can act as key catalysts for action in policy processes. For this research, I interviewed politicians, officials, bankers and other experts across the three countries. My research has been presented at the Bank of England and published in the journal Business & Politics

I am also an author and collaborator of the Tax Introduction Database, an unprecedented project tracking the introduction dates and rates of six major taxes that helped shape modern tax states. Our data are available free and open access [here](http://tid.seelkopf.eu/) and our work and preliminary findings have been published in the [Review of International Organizations](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11558-019-09359-9).

*I hold a BA (First-Class Hons.) in International Relations and Politics from the University of Sheffield (2011). I was awarded a postgraduate innovation scholarship to continue my studies at King’s College London, where I received an MA (Pass with Distinction) in International Political Economy from King’s College London (2012)*. *I obtained an MRes (2016) and DPhil (2020) from the EUI.*
