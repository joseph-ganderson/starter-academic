title: The Delicate Party Politics of the City of London

event: Zyen F/S Club Webinar
event_url: https://fsclub.zyen.com/events/all-events/delicate-party-politics-city-london/

location: Online Webinar

summary: A discussion of historical approaches and emergent challenges defining the Conservatives' and Labour's relationships with the City of London. 
abstract: "This talk reviews historical relations between the City of London and the UK's major political parties, takes stock of where we are today and ponders fault lines and potential opportunities in the coming years. While in the main the City has established an enduring affinity to the Conservatives, this relationship has been subject to increased uncertainty and recrimination through the turbulent Brexit detachment, while Labour has striven again to establish its credibility with the sector.

With the sector still suffering a reputational hangover from the 2008 financial crisis, and in the face of disruptive economic, technological and geopolitical headwinds, UK finance finds itself in a politically delicate place. Looking forward, the talk lays out some of the key political challenges facing the sector, and ponders how these challenges might condition the major parties' attitudes towards the City going forward."
